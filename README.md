# FWD Music app

## Setup

Run the application by installing the dependencies with `yarn install`. This should install all of the dependencies
required to run the app.

Once finished you can start the application with `yarn start`. This will open the app on `http://localhost:3000` and the
backend on `http://localhost:3004`.

## Styling
