# FWD Music app

## Setup

Run the application by installing the dependencies with `yarn install`. This should install all of the dependencies
required to run the app.

Once finished you can start the application with `yarn start`. This will open the app on `http://localhost:3000` and the
backend on `http://localhost:3004`.

## Styling

For styling we use [Stitches.dev]("https://stitches.dev/docs/"). Its an easy to use css-in-js theming solution with great performance.

## Testing

E2E testing will be done by cypress. You can run the tests by running `yarn run cypress open`. This will open a new instance
of Cypress and will show which tests are available.
